There is a known issue with the "Open new tab on click" option where
moving with Ctrl + Tab through tabs will open a new tab if you circle
around to the first tab. Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to avoid
that with the Chrome API.
<br />
However, I suppose that
people who use shortcuts for moving through tabs will also use them for
opening new tabs, so they won't need the "Open new tab on click" option.
